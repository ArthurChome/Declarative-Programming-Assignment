* OVERVIEW
* To increase readibility, the assignment has following sections:
* 1. Definite Clause Grammar
* 2. Finite Domains equation solver
* 3. Printing the results
* 4. Tests

/*
* 1. DEFINITE CLAUSE GRAMMAR
* Before the constraint solver can start working,
* our DCG parser must convert the sentences of strings into meaningful representations.
*
* The general workflow for the parser is as follows:
* 1. Detect the different sentences of the input by the keyword 'fullstop'.
* 2. Split a sentence into two parts: a noun_phrase containing the subject(s)
*    and a verb_phrase containing the sentence's verb and object(s).
* 3. When backtracking, pass the subject of the noun_phrase and the verb
*    and object of the verb_phrase.
*    They will form a constraint representation triple of the verb, subject(s) and object(s)
*/

* 4. TESTS
* What follows is a series of tests that show the implementation's effectiveness.
*
* There are 6 tests:
* -parser_test: this predicate takes in data and shows the DCG parser works to start with.
*
* -timetable_50_test: forms a timetable of 50 courses for 10 given professors teaching 5 classes each.
*  dispersed under 3 rooms: those were part of the general rules for the assignment.
*
* -timetable_same_day_test: since -for 50 courses- it is impossible to schedule for instance 2 classes of 10
*  professors, this test shows that it's still managable to schedule up to 10 courses for 2 classes together in the same day.
*
* -timetable_fail_same_day_test: this test shows the solver can fail if there are too much courses to cram in the same day.
*
* -print_solution: print out a timetable with the implemented print predicate for the 'timetable_50' dataset.
*
* -all_tests: try all tests in succession.
